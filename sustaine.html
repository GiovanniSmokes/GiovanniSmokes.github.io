    Sustaine offers a comprehensive suite of energy solutions aimed at reducing costs and enhancing sustainability for businesses and institutions. Their service begins with a simple analysis of a client's energy bill, which their software uses to simulate all available energy options and identify the most cost-effective one. They then present these solutions in a clear manner, including projected savings, and assist in the implementation process by gathering bids from qualified providers and helping the client select the best one​1​.

They stand out in their field by taking away the pressure of high-stakes sales, enabling property owners to make more informed decisions by comparing proposals on an 'apples-to-apples' basis. Testimonials from clients like the Stone Dock Golf Course and the Berkshire Innovation Center highlight the ease and effectiveness of Sustaine's approach, citing significant savings and simplification of the process to secure clean energy solutions​2​.

Furthermore, Sustaine also assists clients in navigating the often complex landscape of rebates and tax credits, claiming to have saved hundreds of businesses over $2 million with such incentives. They offer to handle the retrieval of rebates and tax credits for clients at no additional cost, and they provide a free guide and turnkey service to make the process even simpler​3​.

For businesses in Maine, Sustaine provides assistance with the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP), which offers grants covering up to 50% of clean energy project costs for qualified rural small businesses, with additional tax credits covering an extra 20-40%. Sustaine receives federal funding to complete REAP applications for Maine businesses at no cost, aiding in projects related to heat pumps, insulation, weatherization, equipment replacement, and solar or battery storage​4​.

In summary, Sustaine streamlines the process of transitioning to renewable energy and maximizing energy efficiency, offering tailored recommendations, savings opportunities, and assistance in obtaining rebates and tax credits. Their services encompass a full-cycle approach, from initial analysis to implementation, reporting, and repeat savings through their continuously updated software.
Sustaine also addresses the concerns of medium-sized businesses about rising energy costs. Through the Inflation Reduction Act, which commits $360 billion to reduce energy bills, Sustaine matches businesses with the right incentives, potentially lowering energy bills by 15-35%. They provide a quick assessment tool to estimate potential savings for businesses​1​.

Additionally, Sustaine offers specialized solar energy solutions for small businesses. They recognize that solar energy is not a one-size-fits-all solution and take into account various factors such as geography, savings, location, and cost to tailor their services. Sustaine helps businesses navigate the complexities of solar energy, from understanding state-specific incentives to selecting the optimal solar installation type (rooftop, ground-mount, canopy, or community solar). They also address considerations for power outages by suggesting battery storage or backup generation. Sustaine simplifies the process by providing an easy way to estimate savings and assess solar feasibility for businesses​2​.

Co-founder and CEO Malcolm Smith brings over 25 years of IT leadership in energy, specializing in software design, smart grid, automation and controls, demand response, and utility restructuring. Co-founder and Chairman Gary Fromer has extensive experience in sustainability, energy software-as-a-service, solar, distributed energy projects, and enterprise business software and services. Senior Director of Project Finance Janette Kessler has a background in project development and finance for energy projects, including renewables, transmission, and storage​3​.
